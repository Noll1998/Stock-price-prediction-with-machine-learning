Predicting stock prices with machine learning


  The stock price prediction with machine learning splits the dataset into a subset called training set and a subset called test set which tests the training set precision. Using the Keras library, this python program plots data from 2010-1-1 until today. The training set ranges from 2010-1-1 until 2020-12-31 and the test set ranges from 2021-1-1 until now.

  As noticed, the prediction model lags behind the actual prices and, therefore, should not be completely relied upon for trading. Lastly, the prediction of tomorrowâ€™s price is shown based on the prediction made by the model as below:
